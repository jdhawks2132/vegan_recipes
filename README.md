# Vegan Recipe App

## Live Deployment Links
- [Website](https://jdhawks2132.github.io/vegan_recipes)


## Learning Goals

I built this application to learn how to integrate a Firebase backend. Firebase is a NoSQL database created by Google. Other options include hosting, authentication but in this project I wanted to keep the scope focused on database usage.
